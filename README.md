and click on the screen and alt tab again.

â€¢ Download the files and put into a folder<br>
â€¢ Open the folder on your code editor<br>
â€¢ first, activate the virtual environment by typing this into the terminal:<br>
```python -m venv <placeholder>```<br>
â€¢ second, activate your environment:<br>
```./<placeholder>/Scripts/Activate.ps1```<br>
â€¢ last, install the requirements by typing this in the console:<br>

due to the afk timer of the game being higher there.<br>

in the script, adjusting it to your needs.<br><br>
Now you are all set, just run the script!
